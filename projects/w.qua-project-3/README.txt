ASSUMPTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------------------
- Requires OpenGL 4.6 compatible GPU and drivers
- Requires GLFW, GLEW, GLM, EnTT libraries and ImGui (automatically downloaded via CMake)
- Shader files must be in the correct location (w.qua-project-1/shaders/)
- Assumed right-handed coordinate system
- Assumed counter-clockwise winding order for triangles
- AABB stored as center and half-extents for easier transformations 

BUGS
------
- The rendering of frustrum detection with bounding volumes is buggy:
 + It will display red for Aabbs even though the edge of the bounds of the fustrum is clearly intersecting and likewise for intersection,
   even when the Aabb is inside the fustrum it still renders yellow instead of green. The same can be observed for spheres however this is more
   of a rendering issue because the actual fustrum is actually offset to the right. This can get worse when done in fullscreen. I am unable to figure out
   the cause of the issue for rendering (I suspect its because of an aspect ratio issue). 
- The lines of the rendered fustrum will flicker, this is a floating point issue that I tried to resolve in FustrumRenderer::UpdateFrustum dosent seem to work...

BVH IMPLEMENTATION (Project 3 Extension)
=======================================

Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)
-------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Two construction modes: Top-Down and Bottom-Up.

Top-Down
~~~~~~~~
1. Objects are recursively split into two child nodes until a termination
   condition is met.
2. Supported split heuristics:
   ‚Ä¢ Median of BV centres (default)
   ‚Ä¢ Median of BV extents
   ‚Ä¢ K-even split (k = 2)
3. Supported termination conditions:
   ‚Ä¢ Leaf contains a single object
   ‚Ä¢ Leaf contains a maximum of two objects
   ‚Ä¢ Tree height equals two

Bottom-Up
~~~~~~~~~
1. Start with a leaf node for every object.
2. Repeatedly merge the pair of nodes that minimises a user-selected cost:
   ‚Ä¢ Centre-to-centre distance (Nearest-Neighbour)
   ‚Ä¢ Combined volume
   ‚Ä¢ Combined surface area

Usage
~~~~~
The ImGui "Assignment 2" window now has a "BVH Construction & Visualization"
section where the build method, split/merge heuristic, and termination rule
can be selected. Press "Build BVH" to rebuild the hierarchy. Use the "Show BVH"
checkbox to toggle rendering.

Visualisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every BVH level is rendered in a unique colour (red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, violet) cycling for deeper levels. Both AABB (cube wireframe) and
sphere visualisation are supported.

Observations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
‚Ä¢ Median-centre produces balanced binary trees with good traversal
  performance but occasionally higher node volume.
‚Ä¢ Median-extent often reduces parent volume but may create unbalanced trees and
  slightly deeper hierarchies.
‚Ä¢ K-even (binary) mimics spatial grids; useful for very clustered scenes but
  sensitive to outliers.
‚Ä¢ Nearest-neighbour bottom-up merges geometrically close objects first and tends
  to preserve locality but can inflate volume.
‚Ä¢ Volume and surface-area heuristics both aim to minimise overlap; surface area
  typically yields slightly tighter bounds in practice.
